# RockFetch
RockFetch is a comprehensive web application designed to address the diverse needs of hostel students by providing an integrated platform for buying and selling essentials, coordinating travel plans, and connecting with like-minded peers for collaborative projects.

## Branding and Concept
The term RockFetch symbolizes the essence of the platform. In the vast world of hostel life, where students face numerous small-scale challenges (represented as "pebbles"), RockFetch emerges as the "rock"—a solid, reliable solution. The name reflects the platform's ability to provide significant, impactful answers to the problems hostel students encounter daily.

The rocket in the logo represents the swift and efficient nature of the platform, ensuring that students can quickly find what they need. The word "rock" in "rocket" ties back to the platform's foundational concept, while the arrows indicate the two-way interaction facilitated by the platform—whether it's buying and selling, finding a travel mate, or connecting for collaboration, RockFetch enables seamless, reciprocal exchanges.

Originally focused on hostel students and their specific needs, this project has the potential to scale and serve a broader demographic. By expanding its reach, RockFetch could address a wide range of community-driven requirements across different contexts.

## Key features
### 1. Store
The Store component enables users to easily buy and sell items within the hostel community. Whether you're looking to purchase essential goods or sell items you no longer need, the Store facilitates quick and efficient transactions. The Store uses PostgreSQL for data management and Multer for image uploads, allowing users to post items with images, manage listings, and connect with potential buyers or sellers effortlessly.

### 2. Carpooling
The Carpooling feature allows students to find travel companions for shared journeys, reducing costs and making travel more convenient. Users can join existing travel plans or host their own, inviting others to join them. This feature promotes sustainable travel options and fosters connections, making it easier to plan trips with fellow hostel mates.

### 3. Networking
The Networking component is a hub for students looking to collaborate on academic and personal projects. It connects individuals with similar interests and complementary skill sets, whether they aim to work on research papers, develop startup ideas, or pursue patents. This component fosters a collaborative environment for innovation and academic growth.

## Technical overview
RockFetch is built using a modern and scalable technology stack to ensure optimal performance and user experience. The frontend is developed with HTML, CSS, Advanced CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive and intuitive interface. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, with PostgreSQL handling data storage and retrieval efficiently. Dynamic content rendering is managed through EJS, while a RESTful API facilitates seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
